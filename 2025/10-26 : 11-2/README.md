Prompts today are from ChatGPT with the prompt "can you create prompts for the following languages and difficulty - Python (Easy and Intermediate) - Kotlin (Easy) - MySQL (Easy) - Pandas+NumPy+Matplotlib (Easy and Intermediate)" and "limit it to 1 prompt per difficulty but make that 1 prompt meaningful."

## Legend
| Symbol | Meaning | Comment |
|--------|---------|---------|
| ✅ | Accomplished | Able to create a good code by myself |
| 🚧 | Partially Accomplished | Created bad code, my version (V1) while AI aided AI aided versions (V2+) for future learning |
| ❌ | Not Completed | Not able to create a code within the deadline |

## 🐍 Python
**Easy:** 🚧
- Write a program that takes a list of numbers from the user and returns a new list containing only the prime numbers.

**Intermediate:** ✅
- Create a class BankAccount with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance. Then, create a subclass SavingsAccount that applies monthly interest. Demonstrate its use.


## 🟣 Kotlin
**Easy:** ✅
- Write a Kotlin program that reads a list of numbers from the user and prints the largest and smallest numbers using functions.


## 🗄️ SQL
**Easy:** ✅
- Create a table Orders with columns order_id, customer_name, order_date, and total_amount. Then, write a query to find the total sales per customer.


## 📊 Pandas + NumPy + Matplotlib or PNM
**Easy:** ✅
- Load a CSV file containing sales data, calculate the total sales per product using Pandas, and plot the top 5 products in a bar chart using Matplotlib.

**Intermediate:** ✅
- Given a DataFrame of daily temperatures, use NumPy to compute the 7-day moving average, and plot both the original and smoothed series using Matplotlib.
